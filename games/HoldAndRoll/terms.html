      <strong>Terms &amp; Conditions</strong>

      <p>
        These terms and conditions apply to the Hold &amp; Roll app (hereby referred to as "Application")
        for mobile devices that was created by Deniz Ilkaya (hereby referred to as "Service Provider")
        as a Free service.
      </p>

      <p>
        Upon downloading or utilizing the Application, you are automatically agreeing to the following terms.
        It is strongly advised that you thoroughly read and understand these terms prior to using the Application.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unauthorized copying, modification of the Application, any part of the Application, or our trademarks
        is strictly prohibited. Any attempts to extract the source code of the Application, translate the
        Application into other languages, or create derivative versions are not permitted.
        All trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to the
        Application remain the property of the Service Provider.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Service Provider is dedicated to ensuring that the Application is as beneficial and efficient
        as possible. As such, they reserve the right to modify the Application or charge for their services
        at any time and for any reason. The Service Provider assures you that any charges for the Application
        or its services will be clearly communicated to you.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Application stores and processes personal data that you have provided to the Service Provider
        in order to provide the Service. It is your responsibility to maintain the security of your phone
        and access to the Application. The Service Provider strongly advise against jailbreaking or rooting
        your phone, which involves removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official
        operating system of your device.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please be aware that the Service Provider does not assume responsibility for certain aspects.
        Some functions of the Application require an active internet connection.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are using the application outside of a Wi-Fi area, your mobile network provider’s agreement
        terms still apply. You may incur charges for data usage, including roaming charges.
        By using the application, you accept responsibility for any such charges.
      </p>

      <p>
        Similarly, the Service Provider cannot always assume responsibility for your usage of the application.
        It is your responsibility to ensure that your device remains charged.
      </p>

      <p>
        While the Service Provider strives to ensure that the Application is updated and accurate,
        they rely on third parties for information and accept no liability for losses resulting from
        reliance on the Application.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Service Provider may update or terminate the Application at any time without notice.
        Upon termination, you must cease using the Application and delete it from your device.
      </p>

      <strong>Changes to These Terms and Conditions</strong>
      <p>
        The Service Provider may periodically update their Terms and Conditions.
        Continued use of the Application constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.
      </p>

      <p>These terms and conditions are effective as of 2026-02-01</p>
